## "Hello World" in different programming languages
Yes, this is a rather useless but fascinating repository. Put a star and suggest your programming languages.

## A brief history
The tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as the first program in programming has its historical roots and is associated with various factors.

One version connects the origin of this phrase with the C programming language . In 1972, Dennis Ritchie, the creator of the C language, wrote an article in which the code of a program that displays the phrase "hello, world" was given as an example. It was an easy way to demonstrate the basic concepts of the language, such as displaying text on the screen. Since then, "Hello, world!" it has become a widespread example of an initial program in many programming languages.

Another version connects the origin of the phrase with early computer systems. In some systems, to check the correctness of the compiler or development environment, developers used a simple program that output the phrase "Hello, world!" on the screen. If this program worked without errors and printed the correct phrase, it means that the compiler and the environment were configured correctly.

In any case, over time, the phrase "Hello, world!" has become a symbol for novice programmers and symbolizes the first step in learning a new language or platform. This is a simple and minimal program that allows you to verify the operability of the development environment and master the basic language constructs.
